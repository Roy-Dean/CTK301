		<p class="one"> Welcome to my website! This is where I Roy, share and show all of my creative creations. From art work to pinatas to photoshop images. I hope you enjoy your time here!<br><br>

		This art work to the left is one of my favorites, its a Collage of Oogie Boogie from the Nightmare before Christmas. It was made out of various magazines.<br><br>
	
		The art work to the right is some of my best work as well. The "Tree Splitter" is a collabration project I was apart of. It is an original art piece.<br><br>

		If you are looking for more information on these two art works and all of my other creative creations look no further!
